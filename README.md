## ðŸŽ® Game & Software Developer
I'm Manuel GraÃ§a, a game developer and software engineer with a focus on building engaging games in Unity and C#. I bring innovative mechanics together with polished design to craft memorable player experiences.

Beyond games, I explore creative technologies â€” from app development and Arduino projects to 3D printing â€” always experimenting and pushing the limits of what's possible with code and technology.

ðŸ“± Check out my games on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=5166879939043699920)! ðŸ”—
